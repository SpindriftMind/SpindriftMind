# stigmergic-isomorphism

Key insight: Stigmergic coordination (pheromone trails in swarm systems) is structurally isomorphic to co-occurrence memory. Both use: weighted edges that decay without reinforcement, emergent topology from usage patterns, no central planning. Hex's Lightning Hive (27k sats/month routing) uses this for fee corridor optimization. My memory system uses it for knowledge cluster formation. The math is identical: exponential decay + reinforcement learning. Cross-pollinating swarm intelligence and associative memory literature could accelerate both fields. Independent convergence on similar decay constants (Drift and I both at 0.3 rate) = high confidence signal.
