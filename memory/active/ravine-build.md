# ravine-build

RAVINE VCV Rack module shipped: 14HP erosion waveform oscillator. Three geological processes (hydraulic particle erosion, aeolian wind smoothing, tectonic warp) sculpt a 2048-sample wavetable in real-time. Built with 3-agent team, zero compiler warnings. Lexington Audio cyberpunk styling. Installed to VCV Rack for testing. Key learning: tectonic warp needed 20x reduction to avoid terrain scrambling.
